        "The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. By identifying potential defaulters early, financial institutions can take proactive measures to mitigate risk, adjust loan terms, or deny applications to protect their assets. The model will be trained on historical data, leveraging various applicant attributes and loan details to produce predictions that will guide decision-making in the loan approval process.\n",

The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, along with ROC-AUC, can provide insights into the model's discriminatory power. Use cross-validation for robustness, and adjust the decision threshold to optimize these metrics. Continuously monitor and adjust the model based on real-world performance."
